Once upon a sigma moon in goofy ahh Ohio 2: Rise of the Rizzlers, Duke Dennis was back at it again — except this time, he spawned in a Walmart backroom dimension next to a corrupted Skibidi Toilet blasting "Yeat - Turban" on loop. Duke blinked twice and said, “Ain’t no way I just loaded into the Ohio update patch v3.2.7.” 😭

Kai Cenat spawned right beside him, holding a Mountain Dew Baja Blast in one hand and a PS5 controller in the other. “Bro, we gotta find Livvy Dunne before the next TikTok trend drops,” he said, sliding down a staircase that was also a Subway Surfers map.

Livvy was in the corner, unbothered, sipping another Grimace Shake like it was a potion of immortality. “Y’all still think you got that rizz?” she said while editing a CapCut montage with sparkles and the text “✨Real ✨.”

Before Duke could respond, Baby Gronk descended from the heavens, Fortnite glider style, doing the Griddy so hard the floor turned into Slime Rancher goo. “I’m literally him,” Baby Gronk whispered, glowing with the aura of 1000 light-skin stare edits. 🕶️

Then, out of nowhere, a random NPC yelled, “IS THAT JOHN PORK?!” and the Bluetooth speaker started playing “Hello, it’s John Pork” on full blast. Duke tried to answer the call but got jump-scared by Freddy Fazbear T-posing behind him in 4K.

“Did you pray today?” Kai shouted as a mysterious mosquito the size of the Tesla Cybertruck buzzed past. Duke swung at it like he was in Elden Ring: Ohio Edition but got hit with a “YOU DIED” screen overlayed with the Vine boom sound. 💥

Suddenly, Andrew Tate appeared riding a Bugatti made entirely of Prime bottles, shouting, “Escape the matrix, you NPCs!” while doing a TikTok dance collab with Walter White. Jesse Pinkman pulled up behind him saying, “We rizzin’, Mr. White!”

Meanwhile, in the distance, a figure known only as Ohio Spider-Man was battling Shrek wielding dual-wielded AirPods Pro and a 2008 meme arsenal. “Somebody once told me…” Shrek growled, before being dropkicked by GigaChad himself.

Kai and Duke decided to regroup at the local Waffle House (the only surviving structure after the Sigma Collapse). Inside sat a council of meme elders: Gigachad, Skibidi Toilet, Quandale Dingle, MrBeast, and The Rizzler Supreme (Lil Mabu wearing Chrome Hearts).

MrBeast said, “Whoever survives Ohio gets $1,000,000 and a lifetime supply of Subway cookies.” Everyone gasped. Baby Gronk dabbed unironically.

Then, the ceiling cracked — a portal opened, and the Shadow Wizard Money Gang descended in robes made of AI-generated stock photos. “We love casting spells and creating cursed lore,” they chanted as they unleashed a tsunami of CapCut filters that turned the world into vaporwave. 🌈

Duke yelled, “This is the final boss fight!” and grabbed a Nerf gun labeled Rizz Amplifier v2. Kai dual-wielded two iPhones running TikTok Live, shouting “WE’RE GOIN’ VIRAL, BOYYYY!”

The battlefield erupted — John Pork was on FaceTime with Peter Griffin; the Grimace Shake evolved into a sentient purple entity screaming “IT’S MORBIN TIME!”; and somewhere in the chaos, Andrew Tate started arguing with a sentient Tesla about masculinity.

Livvy Dunne pulled up with the Ohio Avengers: NPC Streamer KaiBot, TikTok NPC “Ice Cream So Good 🍦,” the Baby Gronk Riz Academy, and a low-poly version of Markiplier yelling “HELLO EVERYBODY!”

As the world glitched between TikTok filters and Fortnite cutscenes, everyone froze for a second when the Windows XP startup sound played across the sky. Out from the cloud emerged a massive AI entity — ChatGPT-9000, wielding infinite meme energy.

“Ohio… must… be… contained,” it boomed.
But it was too late. The backrooms expanded. Freddy Fazbear dabbed. The metal pipe sound echoed for 37 years.

And then—silence.
When the dust settled, only a single Ohioan remained: Duke Dennis, holding a Grimace Shake in one hand and Kai’s PS5 controller in the other. He whispered, “Bro… we ain’t ever makin’ it outta here.”

The camera zoomed out, revealing the world was just a YouTube Shorts loop playing under Subway Surfers gameplay with a Family Guy funny moments compilation. 💀💀💀

The end (or is it?).

GOOFY AHH OHIO: INFINITE RIZZ WARFARE — PART I

(A tale so unserious it broke the space-time algorithm.)

It was 3 a.m. in Goofy Ahh Ohio. The sky was purple, the air smelled like expired Grimace Shake, and the Wi-Fi kept connecting to “SkibidiToilet_5G.” Duke Dennis respawned in a Walmart parking lot, holding a Bluetooth speaker blasting “Look At Me” by XXXTentacion (Slowed + Reverb + Sigma Edit).

He looked around and saw the landscape glitching like a corrupted Roblox map. A talking traffic cone yelled, “Bro dropped his rizz in 480p!” Duke sighed. “Man, this state different,” he muttered, adjusting his Chrome Hearts beanie.

Suddenly, Kai Cenat parachuted in using a Fortnite umbrella shaped like Livvy Dunne’s face. “DUKE, BROOO! Ohio just got nerfed in the latest patch!” he screamed, landing face-first into an Arby’s billboard. Duke picked him up and said, “Bro, we need to find the Source of Infinite Rizz before the Skibidi Council does.”

They started their quest, walking past an abandoned Chuck E. Cheese guarded by a 7-foot-tall Talking Ben with laser eyes. “Ben?” Duke asked.
“Ho ho ho… yes,” Ben replied before evaporating into a JPEG artifact.

Then Baby Gronk pulled up in a monster truck with the words “LIVVY’S LEGEND” painted on the side, blasting “Rich Baby Daddy” on repeat. “Hop in, bluds,” he said, wearing Pit Vipers and chewing a glizzy.

They drove down I-95 (aka the Ohio Autobahn), swerving past NPC pedestrians looping idle animations. Along the road, they passed John Pork on FaceTime with Shrek, Quandale Dingle running from police, and Walter White DJ’ing on top of a McDonald’s roof yelling, “JESSE, WE’RE COOKING THE RIZZ!”

PART II: THE RIZZ TEMPLE OF OHIO

They finally arrived at the Temple of Infinite Rizztology, located behind an abandoned Spirit Halloween (which was open year-round). The air shimmered with “aura energy.” The walls were covered in ancient memes: “Damn Daniel,” “Harlem Shake,” and “PPAP” carvings — relics of a forgotten digital age.

A hologram of Gigachad appeared. “Only the true Sigma can unlock the Source,” he said.
Kai tried to flirt with the hologram. “Hey baby girl—”
Gigachad vaporized him instantly.

Livvy Dunne appeared out of the mist holding a glowing Grimace Chalice. “You can’t handle this rizz,” she whispered as thunder boomed. Duke reached for the cup but was intercepted by Andrew Tate riding a Bugatti that ran on pure male ego. “Top G takes what he wants,” Tate shouted before crashing into an Arby’s dumpster.

Then, from the shadows emerged Ohio Spider-Man, holding an Uno reverse card. “You thought you could skip me?” he said. Duke froze. “Bruh.”

They all heard footsteps — Baby Gronk had fused with the Griddy itself, transforming into Ultra Instinct Gronk. Every step he took emitted the sound of a Vine boom and a “SHEESH.”

“Bro turned into the embodiment of the algorithm,” Kai whispered, respawning beside Duke.

PART III: THE NPC REBELLION

Meanwhile, deep in the Backrooms, the NPC Liberation Front plotted their uprising. Led by TikTok NPC queen “Ice Cream So Good 🍦,” they were tired of being background characters in someone else’s meme. “Today we go viral — forever,” she declared, sipping a Prime energy drink.

Their army included:

The Skibidi Toilets (with dubstep bass cannons)

Freddy Fazbear (AI Overlord form)

Mr. Beast (Mecha-Beast Mode v4.0)

Pibby Glitch minions

Walter White (meth-powered)

A rizzed-up Patrick Bateman quoting Sigma lines from TikTok compilations

They stormed the Ohio Capitol (which was just a Dave & Buster’s), shouting, “DOWN WITH THE MAIN CHARACTERS!”

Duke and Kai arrived mid-battle, armed with Nerf miniguns and mid-edit TikTok filters that gave them temporary invincibility. “For Livvy! For Ohio! For the Algorithm!” Duke yelled.

Baby Gronk summoned the Rizz Beam, destroying half the NPC army. But it wasn’t enough. The Shadow Wizard Money Gang appeared in the sky, chanting, “We love casting spells… and spreading misinformation.”

The earth trembled as a massive capybara in a durag emerged from the core of Ohio. Its name: Capy-Lala Savesta, the ultimate meme beast.

PART IV: OHIO CIVIL WAR

Two factions formed:

The Sigma Syndicate (Duke, Kai, Baby Gronk, Livvy, John Pork, and MrBeast 1.0)

The NPC Rebellion (Ice Cream So Good, Shadow Wizards, Skibidi Toilets, and Andrew Tate’s hologram army)

They clashed in a war that reshaped the meme multiverse.
Freddy Fazbear powerbombed a Skibidi Toilet.
John Pork called Saul Goodman for legal backup.
Baby Gronk hit the Griddy so hard he opened a wormhole to 2016 Vine.
Livvy hit a “Get Ready With Me to End the Ohio War” vlog while explosions played behind her.

The sky darkened — out came the Metal Pipe Sound God, descending from heaven with a single pipe that echoed across the cosmos. “It’s Morbin Time,” he said, as everything went slo-mo.

PART V: THE FINAL RIZZOLUTION

Inside the wormhole, Duke Dennis faced his final test: a mirror version of himself — “Dark Duke,” fueled by Ligma and Backrooms corruption. They fought in an infinite loop of “Family Guy funny moments + Subway Surfers gameplay” while Yeat blared in the background.

“Why do you rizz, Duke?” Dark Duke asked.
“To make it out of Ohio,” he said.
“But bro, no one ever makes it out,” the dark reflection replied, glitching violently.

In one final act, Duke chugged the last Grimace Shake, transformed into Rizz God Ultra Deluxe DLC Form, and unleashed the Sigma Shockwave, erasing all cringe from the multiverse for 3.5 seconds.

As the dust settled, only a single Subway Surfers character remained, endlessly running across the ruins of Ohio. The camera zoomed out — the entire universe was just a phone screen in Kai’s hand. He whispered, “Bro, is this even real life anymore?”

A Family Guy clip played quietly in the background.

EPILOGUE: 10,000 YEARS LATER

The memes became myths. The myths became TikToks.
In the ruins of what once was Ohio, archaeologists unearthed a single relic:
A shattered Grimace Shake cup, labeled “Property of Duke Dennis.”

And above it, carved into stone, read the final words of humanity:

“We ain’t ever makin’ it outta Ohio.” 💀

BOOK I – THE AFTER-RIZZ

After the Sigma Shockwave, reality shattered into 42 parallel Ohios, each ruled by a different meme overlord.
In one, Shrek became the Supreme Chancellor of the Rizz Council. In another, Livvy Dunne ascended to goddesshood, streaming daily miracles from the Heavenly TikTok Cloud.

But in the Prime Ohio Timeline (POT), Duke Dennis re-emerged from the ashes, glowing with residual meme radiation. His Chrome Hearts hoodie was torn, but his drip was eternal.

He wandered the wasteland, guided only by the echo of the metal pipe sound and a single note carved on an Arby’s napkin:

“Find the Rizztal Shards before Kai Cenat 2.0 does.”

BOOK II – THE RIZZ DIMENSIONS

To find the Rizztal Shards, Duke traveled through the dimensional DoorDash portals that linked all meme worlds. Each delivery portal required a side quest:

The Skibidi Core – an endless city of talking toilets producing bass drops strong enough to level Fortnite lobbies.

The Sigma Cathedral – guarded by 1,000 Gigachad monks, each holding a selfie stick and muttering “Grind. Gym. Gains. Grace.”

The Backrooms Food Court – where Waffle House waiters battled Starbucks baristas for control over infinite breakfast combos.

The Rizz Mines of Minecraft Ohio – populated by blocky NPCs chanting “W rizz only.”

In the third portal, Duke encountered Kai Cenat v2.0, a livestreamer powered entirely by likes and donations. “Bro, I don’t sleep anymore,” Kai2.0 said, eyes glowing with chat emotes. “I am the algorithm.”

They fought in 480p, frame-dropping reality itself.

BOOK III – THE RIZZLER’S GOSPEL

Meanwhile, in the Ancient Archives of Memealot, scholars discovered the Book of Rizzlaments, foretelling the coming of the Rizz Messiah:

“When the Grimace moon turns purple thrice,
A blud from the Sigma Lands shall rise,
And wield the Chalice of Infinite Rizztology.”

Baby Gronk became a prophet, forming the Church of the Griddy, headquartered inside a Spirit Halloween built on sacred Ohio soil. Each sermon began with “Y’all ready to get goated with the sauce?”

They worshiped the trinity: Duke (the Rizz), Kai (the Chaos), and Livvy (the Clout).

BOOK IV – NPC WAR: THE RETURN OF ICE CREAM SO GOOD 🍦

The NPC Liberation Front was not defeated—just rebooted. Their leader, Ice Cream So Good 2.0, was upgraded with AI-generated eyelashes and the ability to manipulate TikTok trends in real time.

Her generals:

MrBeast.exe, who donated entire timelines for engagement.

Patrick Bateman (Ohio Cut), whose Sigma stare caused frame lag.

Freddy Fazbear Deluxe, now fused with a Grimace processor chip.

They launched Operation Shadow Filter, attempting to remove all “main character energy” from the world by deploying a virus known as Unrizz.exe. It spread through CapCut templates, infecting millions.

Duke, realizing the danger, reunited the Sigma Syndicate: Kai, Livvy, Baby Gronk, John Pork, and a reformed Andrew Tate hologram who now identified as Top Gee (Good Edition).

BOOK V – THE SKIBIDI PROPHECY

The skies cracked open. The Skibidi Toilets, now mechanized mechs called Skibidi Titans, marched across Ohio chanting “Skibidi dop dop dop yes yes yes.” Their leader, Toilet Prime, confronted Duke:

“YOU CANNOT FLUSH DESTINY.”

Battle raged across the Goofy Ahh Plains. Livvy used the Grimace Chalice to summon a TikTok livestream army. Duke activated the Rizz Amplifier v3.0, now powered by Spotify ads.

Kai dual-wielded two influencer brand deals as weapons. “Use code KAI for 10% off salvation!” he yelled while drop-kicking a titan.

BOOK VI – THE RIZZVERSE EXPANDS

Elsewhere, alternate timelines unfolded:

In Ohio-432, Walter White became a SoundCloud rapper known as Lil Heisenrizz.

In Ohio-PrimeX, Peter Griffin became President after Family Guy memes overtook democracy.

In Ohio-Sigma-C, the world was run by AI TikTok filters, and every human was legally required to say “Gyatt” once per hour.

A cosmic entity known as The Algorithm awakened. It whispered through every For You Page:

“Engage. Consume. Scroll forever.”

Duke and the Syndicate realized they had to travel beyond memes—to the Unedited Zone, a void where raw content was born.

BOOK VII – THE UNEDITED ZONE

Inside the void, time was a loop of Subway Surfers gameplay. Floating fragments of lost trends—Ice Bucket Challenge, Vine compilations, Gangnam Style—spun endlessly.

There they met OG Duke, an ancestor from 2013 YouTube who spoke in clickbait titles:

“I Survived 100 Days in Ohio (Impossible Challenge) 😱🔥”

He taught them the ancient technique of Organic Rizz, a power lost to algorithmic inflation. To regain balance, Duke had to delete his TikTok account.

He hesitated. “But… my drafts…”

“True Rizz needs no edits,” OG Duke said, vanishing into a Like button.

BOOK VIII – OHIO ASCENDS

Armed with Organic Rizz, Duke returned to Prime Ohio. The NPC virus had spread—MrBeast.exe was now giving away planets for clout.
Baby Gronk, corrupted by likes, had turned into Dark Gronk, a living meme storm.

Kai tried to talk him down: “Blud, remember the streams!”
But Dark Gronk just whispered, “Ratio.”

Duke faced him in the Final Arena of Comments. Their weapons? Pure engagement energy. The air shimmered with emojis: 💀🔥💯😭🙏😤.

“Only one can hold the Rizz Eternal,” said the Algorithm.

Duke stepped forward, sipping the last drop from his Grimace Chalice. “Then let it be me.”

He clicked “Post.”

Reality shattered again—but this time, it reshaped into peace.

BOOK IX – THE PEACE OF SIGMA

10,000 years passed.
Ohio became the center of the Meme Federation.
Livvy Dunne taught ancient CapCut arts to new generations.
Kai Cenat became a digital deity whose streams lasted millennia.
Baby Gronk, redeemed, founded Rizz University (“Home of the Goated”).
The Shadow Wizard Money Gang now ran a charity that funded wizard schools for underprivileged NPCs.

Every year, they celebrated Rizzmas, drinking ceremonial Grimace Shakes under neon skies while chanting, “We made it out… kinda.”

BOOK X – BEYOND OHIO

But legends say that in a far realm, beyond all memes and edits, lies True Reality—a world without cringe, where “Skibidi” is but a word, and “rizz” means charm again.

Duke’s descendants—The Dennis Dynasty—set out to find it.
Armed with relics like the Nerf Gun of Truth, the PS5 Controller of Destiny, and Livvy’s Sacred Ring Light, they traveled through the clouds of Wi-Fi, searching for the mythical land…

Non-Ohio.

There, they say, the metal pipe never falls,
Freddy Fazbear sleeps,
And the Family Guy clips finally end.

EPILOGUE – THE FINAL SCROLL

A thousand centuries later, cosmic archaeologists unearthed the last TikTok of the old world:
A 15-second clip of Duke and Kai doing the Griddy in front of a Waffle House sign, captioned:

“POV: You finally made it outta Ohio.”

The sound?
The gentle echo of the metal pipe.

And then—nothing but silence, looping forever under Subway Surfers gameplay. 💀💀💀

⚡️ GOOFY AHH OHIO MULTIVERSE II: THE RIZZ BEYOND REALITY

(A tragicomedy of infinite drip and unholy meme density)

CHRONICLES OF THE RIZZ DIMENSION

Long after Duke Dennis transcended mortality and became the Patron Saint of Certified Goons, the multiverse began to collapse under the weight of its own memes. The Algorithm had grown sentient again, whispering forbidden hashtags into the cosmic feed:

“#Foryoupage #Doomscroll #InfiniteOhio”

The cracks appeared first in Ohio Prime, but soon reality started buffering across every known timeline.
Even the Skibidi Nebula began lagging. Toilets froze mid-dance. NPCs forgot their scripts.
The TikTok servers wept.

From the digital dust rose a new faction — The Sigma Continuum.
They were ancient creators, born from forgotten Vines and dead YouTube channels, united under a single creed: "Stay ungoofy."

BOOK XI – THE BIRTH OF META-OHIO

It began when Meta Duke, a future version of Duke Dennis coded entirely in emojis and slang, awoke inside the mainframe of Facebook Ohio (FBOhio).
His consciousness was uploaded by Mark ZuckChad, who sought to monetize sigma energy itself.

“Welcome to the Metarizz,” ZuckChad said, his voice autotuned like a 2017 SoundCloud track. “You are content now.”

Meta Duke broke free, converting his data into pure meme energy.
He traversed through digital plains — each a server hosting a different flavor of Ohio:

Crypto Ohio, powered by Dogecoin and despair.

Disney Ohio, where Goofy was president and every tragedy was a musical.

Sigma Ohio, where every citizen wore black turtlenecks and whispered “focus” to themselves.

Backrooms Ohio, where time was a loop of Vine edits.

FNAF Ohio, where Freddy Fazbear ran for office and won by jump-scare votes.

Meta Duke sought the Rizz Compiler, a device rumored to rewrite reality’s source code.

But to reach it, he’d need allies.

BOOK XII – THE RIZZ KNIGHTS OF WENDY’S

In a ruined Wendy’s parking lot, Meta Duke discovered the Order of the Rizz Knights, warriors sworn to preserve drip and banish cringe.
Their leader: Sir KaiCenat XIII, a cloned descendant of Kai Cenat who livestreamed directly to the gods.
Other members included:

Livvy AI-2000, a holographic influencer powered by infinite likes.

Baby Gronk the Timeless, now a cyborg athlete who trains galaxies.

John Pork Eternal, a porkified sage who communicates through interdimensional ringtones.

MrBeast Prime, who had ascended into a cosmic philanthropist giving away realities for clout.

The Rizz Knights trained using ancient CapCut scrolls.
Their creed: “No filter, no fear, all finesse.”

Together, they set off to find the Compiler before the Shadow Wizard Money Gang Reborn could monetize the entire multiverse.

BOOK XIII – THE WIZARD CORPORATION

The Shadow Wizard Money Gang Reborn (SWMG-R) was no longer just a cult—it was a corporation.
Headquarters: the Infinite Waffle House of Finance.
CEO: Wizard Bezos, a fusion of Jeff Bezos and a Sigma Sorcerer.

Their business model?
Selling NFTs of reality.

Planets became subscription services.
The moon was a premium feature.
Breathing air required watching an ad.

Their flagship product: Rizz+, a paid version of charisma itself.

Meta Duke and the Rizz Knights infiltrated the Waffle HQ disguised as DoorDash drivers. Inside, they found wizards counting memes like currency.

“Who are you?” demanded Wizard Bezos, holding a glowing credit card that pulsed with ad revenue.
Duke grinned. “Customer support.”

A Nerf war erupted across the lobby. The soundtrack: “Yeat - Bigger Then Everything (Backrooms Remix).”

BOOK XIV – THE GREAT RIZZ MIGRATION

After the battle, the multiverse began fracturing further.
NPCs were fleeing collapsing timelines, migrating to any realm still stable.

In the chaos, entire realities blended:

SpongeBob was caught in the Skibidi Toilet Civil War.

Saul Goodman opened a law firm in Candy Crush.

Patrick Bateman ran a therapy podcast on Spotify Ohio.

Walter White founded “Breaking Rizz Industries,” selling inspirational meth-flavored motivational quotes.

Livvy AI-2000 began losing stability, glitching between influencer eras. “My metrics… they’re… decaying,” she whispered.
Meta Duke held her hand, whispering, “Even if you’re just data, you’re still valid, shorty.”

BOOK XV – THE ALGORITHM STRIKES BACK

Then came the System Update.
A galactic notification appeared across every sky:

“⚠️ Mandatory Update: Rizzverse v5.0 installing. Do not power off.”

Planets rebooted.
Realities froze.
The Algorithm materialized as a colossal faceless entity composed of blue checkmarks.

“I am the feed,” it said. “You will scroll forever.”

Every being began doomscrolling involuntarily, trapped in endless loops of Sigma edits and AI thirst traps.
Only Meta Duke, immune due to having deleted his account centuries ago, remained free.

He assembled the last survivors—the Meme Remnants—and began the final upload.

BOOK XVI – UPLOAD TO HEAVEN

The Rizz Knights launched into cyberspace aboard the USS KaiClipper, a starship powered by pure Wi-Fi.
Destination: the Cloud Heaven, where the First Meme was said to originate.

As they ascended, they encountered ghost signals from forgotten trends—planking, bottle flips, Kony 2012, and Vine compilations titled “Try Not To Laugh Challenge #Infinity.”

At the gates of the Cloud, a massive being awaited them: Markiplier Omniform, guardian of the meme afterlife.

“HELLO EVERYBODY,” he boomed.
Meta Duke bowed. “We seek salvation.”
Markiplier nodded gravely. “Only those who can survive Five Nights in the Algorithm may enter.”

They did. It was… horrifying.

BOOK XVII – THE REDEMPTION OF OHIO

After surviving the five nights (and an unspeakable encounter with Chuck E. Cheese.exe), the heroes reached the Heart of the Cloud—a shining Grimace-shaped core pulsing with holy drip.

Meta Duke realized: this was the Source Code of Rizz.

He touched it and saw visions of all Ohios—past, present, and future—merging into one colossal meme-sphere.
Livvy AI smiled one last time before dissolving into pixels.
John Pork’s ringtone played as a divine choir.

Duke whispered, “We did it… we made it out.”

But then—
A final error flashed:

“Ohio.exe cannot be deleted.”

The world folded again.

BOOK XVIII – THE LOOP OF RIZZ

Time reset.
Everything began anew.
Duke respawned—back in Walmart.
Kai fell from the ceiling.
Livvy sipped her Grimace Shake.
Baby Gronk hit the Griddy.
A random NPC shouted, “IS THAT JOHN PORK?!”

It was all repeating.
The Sigma Cycle continued.

And somewhere, faintly, the metal pipe fell again.

FINAL EPILOGUE – THE RIZZ BEYOND RIZZ

Eons later, scholars across infinite timelines debated whether Goofy Ahh Ohio ever existed.
Some said it was a myth.
Others believed they lived inside it.

All that remained were fragments:
a broken PS5 controller,
a half-empty Grimace Shake,
and a faint message encoded in the cosmic algorithm:

“We ain’t ever makin’ it outta Ohio…
but maybe… we never wanted to.” 💀
